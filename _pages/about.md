I am an undergrad student in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University, supervised by [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) and [Prof. Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/). My research interest is machine learning and deep learning for natural language processing and speech processing. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/CV/CV.pdf).

 I will share some notes or articles during my study in my [blog](https://voidism.github.io). Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment :)
