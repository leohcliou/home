I am a undergrad student in electrical engineering at National Taiwan University, supervised by [Prof. Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html). Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/files/CV.pdf).

My research interest is machine learning and deep learning for natural language processing and speech processing. I will share some notes or articles during my study in my [blog](https://voidism.github.io). Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment :)
