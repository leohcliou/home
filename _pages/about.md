I am now an undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at National Taiwan University. My research interest broadly covers the deep learning technique for natural language processing and speech processing. In particular, I aim to utilize the ability of machines to help people grasp large information in text/audio form in efficient ways. Towards this goal, I joined Speech Processing Lab supervised by [Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) and Machine Intelligence Understanding Lab supervised by [Yun-Nung (Vivian) Chen](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~yvchen/). Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/CV/CV.pdf).

 I will share some notes or articles during my study in my [blog](https://voidism.github.io). Thanks for reading and taking the time to comment :)
